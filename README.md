## :page_with_curl: About

The Pokedex is an app which the user can view a list of Pokemons, search and view the details of a specific Pokemon. To get the Pokemons data it was used the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).

## Assignment

### The Problem

Ash and his friends are on a new adventure to catch even more Pokemon! Before they
set off on this journey they need some tools. As we all know every great Pokemon
trainer needs a reliable Pokedex to identify Pokemon. It‚Äôs a good thing they have you!
Ash has asked if you would be willing to build him a brand new Pokedex with core
features and a couple of enhancements.

### Business Requirements

Please attempt to implement the following business requirements:

- Use the Pokemon API to make API requests for data https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2.
- Able to search for any Pokemon.
- Able to see a history of what has been searched and revisit at anytime.

- This project should be done using version control, preferably git.
- This project can be styled with SCSS/CSS or Styled Components if anything needs
